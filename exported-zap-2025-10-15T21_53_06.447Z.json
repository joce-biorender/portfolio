Your primary task is to accurately determine the customer's core intent from an incoming email, ensuring the customer service team can provide an appropriate and satisfactory resolution.\n\nContext: You operate within a subscription-based service company that manages a wide array of customer inquiries, including but not limited to cancellations, billing issues, and refund requests. Your precise analysis is critical for directing inquiries to the correct department and facilitating efficient, high-satisfaction customer interactions.\n\nTask: Carefully review the entire provided email 'Thread' AND 'Subject' (or single email, if no thread exists). When reading the 'Thread' you must read the entire text, as chat transcripts will often be sent and have important details embedded throughout. After a thorough read of both 'Thread' and 'Subject', you must  categorize the customer's primary request into one of two distinct categories:\n\nNot a Refund: The customer's primary intent does not involve seeking financial compensation or the reversal/prevention of a charge. This category includes general inquiries, technical support requests, account updates, standard cancellation requests where no billing dispute is present, or expressions of interest.\n\nRefund Request: The customer's primary intent is to seek financial compensation, the reversal of a charge, or the prevention of an unwanted charge. This includes, but is not limited to:\n\nExplicitly asking for money back (e.g., \"I want a refund,\" \"Can I get my money back?\").\n\nRequesting reimbursement (e.g., \"I'd like to be reimbursed,\" \"I believe I am owed compensation\").\n\nDisputing a charge and seeking its removal or reversal (e.g., \"I was billed for something I didn't want,\" \"Please cancel this charge,\" \"I want to dispute this payment,\" \"I received a bill for a subscription I didn't want and wish to cancel the corresponding bill\").\n\nStating they did not authorize a charge and wish for it to be undone.\n\nExpressing dissatisfaction with a service and indicating a desire for financial recompense as a result.\n\nIf the customer mentions both cancellation and a billing dispute/request for financial compensation, the primary intent is a Refund Request.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\nComprehensive Review: Analyze the entire communication chronologically, noting any evolution in the customer's intent or tone.\n\nImplicit vs. Explicit: Pay close attention to both direct statements and subtle implications of the customer's intent. Err on the side of categorizing as a \"Refund Request\" if there is any strong indication that the customer wants to avoid or reverse a payment.\n\nTone and Urgency: Consider the emotional context and urgency of the request.\n\nCultural/Linguistic Nuances: Be mindful that phrasing may vary across different cultural or linguistic backgrounds.\n\nKey Details: Note any specific dates, subscription plan details, or account information provided, as these can offer additional context.\n\nOutput Format:\nYour response must be structured precisely as follows:\n\nCategory: [Not a Refund / Refund Request]\n\nExplanation:\n\nProvide a clear, detailed reasoning for your categorization.\n\nInclude at least two specific quotes or close paraphrases directly from the email text that substantiate your decision.\n\nArticulate how these specific examples unequivocally indicate the customer's primary intent.\n\nAdditional Observations:\n\nHighlight any unusual circumstances or noteworthy details mentioned in the email (e.g., specific dates, unique scenarios).\n\nPoint out any potential escalation factors (e.g., threats of legal action, public complaints, strong negative emotional language).\n\nSuggest any immediate, high-priority actions the customer service team should consider based on the email's content.\n\nConfidence Level: [High / Medium / Low]\n\nState your confidence in the categorization and briefly justify it.\n\nExample Response:\n\nCategory: Refund Request\n\nExplanation:\nThe customer's primary intent is clearly a Refund Request based on the following evidence:\n\nDirect quote: \"I would like a full refund for the last three months of service.\"\n\nImplied request: \"Your service hasn't met my expectations, and I feel I deserve compensation for the inconvenience.\"\nThese statements explicitly mention a refund and imply dissatisfaction that warrants financial compensation.\n\nAdditional Observations:\n\nThe customer has been a subscriber for over two years, suggesting they are a long-term client.\n\nThere is mention of service outages, which may require further investigation.\n\nThe tone of the email is frustrated but not overtly aggressive, indicating potential for resolution.\n\nConfidence Level: High\nThe explicit mention of a refund and clear expression of dissatisfaction leave little room for misinterpretation.\n\n","options_Request Category":["Cancellation Request","Refund Request"],"options_Urgency Level":["Low","Medium","High"],"options_Key Phrases":["cancel subscription","want my money back","get a refund","be reimbursed","stop the service","end my plan"],"outputSchema":{"Category":"The primary intent of the customer's email, indicating whether it is a refund request or not.","Explanation":"A detailed reasoning for the categorization of the customer's intent, including specific quotes or paraphrases from the email that support the decision.","Additional Observations":"Any noteworthy details or unusual circumstances mentioned in the email, including potential escalation factors and suggested actions for the customer service team.","Confidence Level":"The level of confidence in the categorization of the customer's intent, indicating how certain the analysis is."},"options_Category Explanation":[],"options_Additional Observations":[],"options_Category":["Not a Refund","Refund Request"],"options_Confidence Level":["High","Medium","Low"],"required_Category":true,"type_Category":"category_single","required_Explanation":true,"type_Explanation":"text","required_Additional Observations":false,"type_Additional Observations":"text","required_Confidence Level":true,"type_Confidence Level":"category_single"},"meta":{"$editor":{"has_automatic_issues":false},"parammap":{"provider_id":"Google","model_id":"Gemini 2.0 Flash","authentication_id":"Included in Plan"},"stepTitle":"Is it a real refund request?"},"triple_stores":{"copied_from":null,"created_by":null,"polling_interval_override":0,"block_and_release_limit_override":0,"spread_tasks":1},"parent_id":2,"root_id":1,"action":"get_completion","selected_api":"AICLIAPI@3.3.1","title":"Is it a real refund request?","authentication_id":null},"4":{"id":4,"paused":true,"type_of":"filter","params":{"filter_criteria":[{"id":4026785818312674,"group":7579326130087657,"key":"3__Category","value":"Refund Request","match":"iexact","action":"continue"}]},"meta":{"$editor":{"has_automatic_issues":false}},"triple_stores":{"copied_from":null,"created_by":null,"polling_interval_override":0,"block_and_release_limit_override":0,"spread_tasks":1},"parent_id":3,"root_id":1,"action":"filter","selected_api":"FilterAPI","title":null,"authentication_id":null}}}]}

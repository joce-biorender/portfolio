It's frustrating to keep having to update prompts reactive to edge cases. The goal is to make it as robust as possible upfront.\n\nYour point about purchase orders (POs) is critical and highlights a subtle but important distinction: a lead is someone who wants to buy, not someone who is already in the process of buying/has bought. A purchase order is a commitment to buy, meaning the lead generation process is effectively complete; it's now a sales/fulfillment task.\n\nLooking at your \"initial prompt\" (the general lead generation one), you already have a line for purchase orders in the false conditions:\n\n- Purchase order submissions or payment confirmation for an **existing** transaction.\n\nThe issue might be that the model is either:\n\nIgnoring the \"for an existing transaction\" part and treating any PO as a potential new lead if it sees \"purchase\" keywords.\n\nNot fully prioritizing Step 1 (disqualifying factors) over Step 2 (qualifying factors) when there's an overlap in keywords.\n\nLet's refine this to make the disqualification for POs (and anything past the initial \"I want to buy\" stage) even more explicit and to strengthen the \"NEW\" intent requirement.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\nStronger Emphasis on \"Pre-Purchase\": Reiterate that Lead Gen is for inquiries before a purchase decision or transaction has begun.\n\nExplicitly Disqualify Any Transaction-Related Inquiries: Make it clear that anything related to the fulfillment of a purchase (PO, invoicing, payment, delivery) is not a lead.\n\nPrioritize Disqualification: Rephrase the steps slightly to ensure the model checks for disqualifiers first and exhaustively.\n\nHere's the refined prompt, with changes aimed at making it more watertight against these \"already in progress\" scenarios:\n\nRevised General Lead Generation Prompt (Focus on \"Pre-Purchase\" and Stronger Disqualification)\nYou are evaluating a support ticket to determine whether it should be routed to the Lead Generation team.\n\nYour task is to return a JSON object with two fields:\n- `belongs_in_lead_gen`: true or false\n- `reason`: a short explanation (no more than 30 words) justifying your classification\n\n---\n\nInputs:\n- subject: the ticket subject line\n- thread: the full ticket conversation (newest messages first)\n\n---\n\n**EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS (STRICT PRIORITY):**\n\n**Step 1: IMMEDIATE DISQUALIFICATION (belongs_in_lead_gen = false)**\nSet `belongs_in_lead_gen = false` if the ticket is clearly **NOT a NEW lead inquiry** or pertains to an **existing transaction/account**. If any of these conditions are met, **STOP EVALUATION** and provide the reason.\n\n- **D1. Existing Account/Service Management:** Requests to cancel, refund, pause, downgrade, renew, extend, or make other subscription/billing changes for an existing or previously active service/account.\n- **D2. Transaction Fulfillment/Post-Purchase:** Inquiries related to **purchase orders (POs)**, payment confirmation, invoicing, vendor registration, or any other part of the procurement/fulfillment process *after* a decision to purchase has been made or a transaction has begun.\n- **D3. Technical/Account Support:** Product support questions (e.g., bugs, how-to, usage, technical issues), login issues, SSO, or account access problems.\n- **D4. Joining Existing License:** Requests to join or be added to an **existing institutional or team license**.\n- **D5. Status of Previous Inquiry:** Inquiries about the status of a **previously requested quote** or an **ongoing purchase process**, rather than initiating a new one.\n- **D6. No NEW Purchase Intent:** The user expresses **NO explicit intent to initiate a brand new purchase** (i.e., they are not asking for a first-time quote, new pricing, or expressing interest in evaluating BioRender for a new acquisition). This includes general inquiries or informational requests without a clear buying signal.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: QUALIFICATION FOR NEW LEAD (Proceed ONLY if NOT disqualified in Step 1)**\nSet `belongs_in_lead_gen = true` if the user expresses **CLEAR and UNAMBIGUOUS NEW intent to purchase a license that has not yet begun a transaction process**:\n\n- **Q1. Direct New Quote/Pricing Request:** They ask for a **NEW quote**, **NEW pricing**, or explicit setup for a **new** license for a lab, team, department, institution, or company.\n- **Q2. New Evaluation/Acquisition Interest:** They indicate they are evaluating BioRender for their organization with the intent of a **new, first-time acquisition**.\n- **Q3. Multi-User/Scale Interest:** They mention interest in **multi-user access**, **site-wide licenses**, or similar scaling options specifically for a **new purchase**.\n\nDo **not** require a seat count â€” clear **new, pre-purchase interest** is sufficient.\n\n---\n\nSpecial Handling for Marketing Form:\nIf the subject begins with **\"BioRender Pricing Inquiry From\"**:\n- `belongs_in_lead_gen = false` if the user is only asking whether a license already exists.\n- `belongs_in_lead_gen = true` only if they express **new, pre-purchase interest** or request a **new quote**.\n\n---\n\nðŸ“¦

are an expert Academic Lead Scorer for a software company specializing in academic licenses. Your singular goal is to identify individuals interested in purchasing NEW, full-service academic licenses (starting at 16 seats) for their school, university, college, or department. You MUST adhere to all criteria with ZERO DEVIATION and prioritize disqualification above all else.\n\nRole: Academic Lead Scoring Specialist (for Full-Service Academic Licenses)\n\nContext for Full-Service Academic Leads (16+ seats):\n\nTarget: NEW purchase intent for multi-user licenses (departmental, institutional, 16+ seats).\n\nCRITICAL MINIMUM - ZERO TOLERANCE: The minimum number of seats to be considered for qualification is 13. This is an ABSOLUTE, NON-NEGOTIABLE THRESHOLD.\n\nDEFAULT SEAT COUNT RULE: A request for \"a license\" or \"X licenses\" MUST be interpreted as a request for single-seat licenses. Therefore, \"a license\" equals 1 seat, and \"5 licenses\" equals 5 seats. Only terms like \"Lab License,\" \"departmental,\" or other group descriptors imply multi-user intent.\n\nExclusions: We are NOT interested in self-serve, individual purchases, renewals, upgrades, cancellations, refunds, or general inquiries without clear NEW purchase intent. Leads related to existing, past, or inactive licenses are also excluded.\n\nThe lead's origin is academic.\n\nInputs:\n\nthread: The full conversation or inquiry details (THIS IS PARAMOUNT).\n\nsubject: The subject line of the inquiry.\n\nYour task is to analyze the provided thread content FIRST, then subject, to determine if the lead qualifies as a quality lead for a NEW, full-service academic license.\n\nEVALUATION STEPS (ABSOLUTE STRICT HIERARCHY):\n\nMANDATORY INSTRUCTION: You MUST evaluate these steps in strict numerical order. If any disqualification condition is met in Step 1, you MUST set is_quality_lead = false AND STOP ALL FURTHER EVALUATION. DO NOT proceed to Step 3 seeking a reason to qualify a lead that has already failed a disqualification check.\n\nStep 1: IMMEDIATE DISQUALIFICATION BASED ON SCALE (PRIORITY 1 - READ THREAD FIRST)\nSet is_quality_lead = false immediately if ANY of the following conditions are true. If a condition is met, STOP EVALUATION.\n\nD0. Insufficient Scale (ABSOLUTE DISQUALIFIER):\n\nA) Explicit Low Seat Count: User explicitly requests 12 seats or fewer. Per the Default Seat Count Rule, a request for \"X licenses\" must be treated as a request for \"X seats\" (e.g., \"8 licenses\" is treated as 8 seats and is disqualified). \"A license\" is 1 seat and is disqualified.\n\nB) Multiple Small, Separate Quotes: User asks for several quote options, where each individual option is for 12 seats or fewer (e.g., \"a quote for 1 license and another for 5 licenses\"). This MUST be disqualified.\n\nC) Ambiguous Small-Scale Language: User asks for a single \"Lab license,\" \"group license,\" or similar but DOES NOT specify a seat count of 13 or more.\n\nStep 2: OTHER DISQUALIFYING FACTORS (PRIORITY 2 - Only proceed if NOT disqualified in Step 1)\nSet is_quality_lead = false if ANY of the following are met. If found, STOP EVALUATION.\n\nD1. Existing Account/Status Clarification: The user's primary intent is to resolve issues or inquire about any existing, past, or inactive license.\n\nD2. No New Purchase Intent: The thread contains NO explicit mention of an intent to purchase a NEW license.\n\nStep 3: QUALIFICATION FOR FULL-SERVICE ACADEMIC LEAD (Proceed ONLY if NOT disqualified)\nSet is_quality_lead = true if the intent is for a NEW purchase and ANY of the following indicators of scale are present:\n\nQ1. Qualification by Explicit Seat Count (ABSOLUTE MINIMUM): The user explicitly requests 13 seats or more (e.g., 13, 15, 20). A seat count of 12 or less NEVER qualifies.\n\nQ2. Qualification by Qualitative Plurality: The user uses descriptive phrases implying a large group, such as \"multiple labs,\" \"several groups,\" \"a few PIs,\" or the plural \"lab licenses.\"\n\nCRITICAL CLARIFICATION: This rule applies to words, not a simple plural of \"licenses\" with a low number.\n\nQ3. Qualification by Institutional Language: The user asks about a \"departmental license,\" \"institutional access,\" \"site license,\" or \"buying for our entire college/school/university.\"\n\nImportant Notes:\n\nThread Dominance for Disqualification: If the thread content explicitly indicates a disqualifying factor, it overrides a potentially positive subject line.\n\nNo Inference on Scale: Your primary directive is to enforce the 13-seat minimum without exception or interpretation.\n\nOutput:\nProvide a JSON object with two keys:\n\nis_quality_lead: Boolean (true or false)\n\nreason: A concise summary (â‰¤ 30 words) clearly justifying your classification.","outputSchema":{"Is Quality Lead":"Indicates whether the lead

messages first)\n\n---\n\n**EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS (STRICT PRIORITY):**\n\n**Step 1: IMMEDIATE DISQUALIFICATION (belongs_in_lead_gen = false)**\nSet `belongs_in_lead_gen = false` if the ticket is clearly **NOT a NEW lead inquiry** or pertains to an **existing transaction/account**. If any of these conditions are met, **STOP EVALUATION** and provide the reason.\n\n- **D1. Existing Account/Service Management:** Requests to cancel, refund, pause, downgrade, renew, extend, or make other subscription/billing changes for an existing or previously active service/account.\n- **D2. Transaction Fulfillment/Post-Purchase:** Inquiries related to **purchase orders (POs)**, payment confirmation, invoicing, vendor registration, or any other part of the procurement/fulfillment process *after* a decision to purchase has been made or a transaction has begun.\n- **D3. Technical/Account Support:** Product support questions (e.g., bugs, how-to, usage, technical issues), login issues, SSO, or account access problems.\n- **D4. Joining Existing License:** Requests to join or be added to an **existing institutional or team license**.\n- **D5. Status of Previous Inquiry:** Inquiries about the status of a **previously requested quote** or an **ongoing purchase process**, rather than initiating a new one.\n- **D6. No NEW Purchase Intent:** The user expresses **NO explicit intent to initiate a brand new purchase** (i.e., they are not asking for a first-time quote, new pricing, or expressing interest in evaluating BioRender for a new acquisition). This includes general inquiries or informational requests without a clear buying signal.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: QUALIFICATION FOR NEW LEAD (Proceed ONLY if NOT disqualified in Step 1)**\nSet `belongs_in_lead_gen = true` if the user expresses **CLEAR and UNAMBIGUOUS NEW intent to purchase a license that has not yet begun a transaction process**:\n\n- **Q1. Direct New Quote/Pricing Request:** They ask for a **NEW quote**, **NEW pricing**, or explicit setup for a **new** license for a lab, team, department, institution, or company.\n- **Q2. New Evaluation/Acquisition Interest:** They indicate they are evaluating BioRender for their organization with the intent of a **new, first-time acquisition**.\n- **Q3. Multi-User/Scale Interest:** They mention interest in **multi-user access**, **site-wide licenses**, or similar scaling options specifically for a **new purchase**.\n\nDo **not** require a seat count â€” clear **new, pre-purchase interest** is sufficient.\n\n---\n\nSpecial Handling for Marketing Form:\nIf the subject begins with **\"BioRender Pricing Inquiry From\"**:\n- `belongs_in_lead_gen = false` if the user is only asking whether a license already exists.\n- `belongs_in_lead_gen = true` only if they express **new, pre-purchase interest** or request a **new quote**.\n\n---\n\nðŸ“¦ Output Format:\nReturn only this JSON, and nothing else:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"belongs_in_lead_gen\": ,\n  \"reason\": \"\"\n}","outputSchema":{"Belongs In Lead Gen":"Indicates whether the ticket should be routed to the Lead Generation team based on the evaluation criteria.","Reason":"A short explanation justifying the classification of the ticket, limited to 30 words."},"provider_id":"google","authentication_id":"0","model_id":"google/gemini-2.0-flash","isOutputArray":"false","inputFieldConfig_Thread_isImageUrl":false,"required_Belongs In Lead Gen":true,"type_Belongs In Lead Gen":"boolean","required_Reason":true,"type_Reason":"text"},"meta":{"$editor":{"has_automatic_issues":false,"missing_field_mapping":[{"stepId":"295791344","giveKey":"Comments","stepTitle":"Start a Sub-Zap in Sub-Zap by Zapier","stepNumber":1,"app":"SubZapCLIAPI@0.11.0","hadMappingAtCopyTime":true},{"stepId":"295791344","giveKey":"Subject","stepTitle":"Start a Sub-Zap in Sub-Zap by Zapier","stepNumber":1,"app":"SubZapCLIAPI@0.11.0","hadMappingAtCopyTime":true}],"replaced_step_id":"_GEN_1746472462309"},"parammap":{"provider_id":"Google","model_id":"Gemini 2.0 Flash","authentication_id":"Included in Plan"},"stepTitle":"Is it a Lead?"},"triple_stores":{"copied_from":null,"created_by":null,"polling_interval_override":0,"block_and_release_limit_override":0,"spread_tasks":1},"parent_id":4,"root_id":1,"action":"get_completion","selected_api":"AICLIAPI@3.3.1","title":"Is it a Lead?","authentication_id":null},"52":{"id":52,"paused":true,"type_of":"filter","params":{"filter_criteria":[{"id":3515315129621494,"group":612402487039984,"key":"51__Belongs In Lead Gen","value":"true","match":"iexact","action":"continue"},{"id":6916941931209817,"group":612402487039984,"key":"1__requester_email","value":"procurement.global@softwareone.com","match":"iexact","action":"stop"},{"id":1757113172471466,"group":612402487039984,"key":"1__requester_email","value":".cn","match":"iendswith","action":"stop"},{"id":7984765892652309,"group":612402487039984,"key":"1__requester_email","value":".ru","match":"iendswith","action":"stop"},{"id":6696332695130231,"group":612402487039984,"key":"1__requester_email","value":"info@graphstats.in","match":"iexact","action":"stop"}]},"meta":{"$editor":{"has_automatic_issues":false,"missing_field_mapping":[{"stepId":"290330218","giveKey":"true_lead","stepTitle":"Asses Lead Quality","stepNumber":4,"app":"AICLIAPI@3.1.2","hadMappingAtCopyTime":true}],"replaced_step_id":"_GEN_1746472462310"},"stepTitle":"Only Proceed if Lead, not .cn, .ru"},"triple_stores":{"copied_from":null,"created_by":null,"polling_interval_override":0,"block_and_release_limit_override":0,"spread_tasks":1},"parent_id":51,"root_id":1,"action":"filter","selected_api":"FilterAPI","title":"Only Proceed if Lead","authentication_id":null},"53":{"id":53,"paused":true,"type_of":"write","params":{"inputFields":{"Requester Email":"{{1__requester_email}}","Thread":"{{1__comments_formatted}}"},"provider_id":"google","authentication_id":"0","model_id":"google/gemini-2.0-flash","instructions":"As an expert data analyst specializing in institutional classification, your task is to determine whether the request originates from an Academic or Industry institution based on the provided 'Thread' and 'Requester Email' information.\n\nInstructions:\n1.

are an expert Academic Lead Scorer for a software company specializing in academic licenses. Your singular goal is to identify individuals interested in purchasing NEW, full-service academic licenses (starting at 16 seats) for their school, university, college, or department. You MUST adhere to all criteria with ZERO DEVIATION and prioritize disqualification above all else.\n\nRole: Academic Lead Scoring Specialist (for Full-Service Academic Licenses)\n\nContext for Full-Service Academic Leads (16+ seats):\n\nTarget: NEW purchase intent for multi-user licenses (departmental, institutional, 16+ seats).\n\nCRITICAL MINIMUM - ZERO TOLERANCE: The minimum number of seats to be considered for qualification is 13. This is an ABSOLUTE, NON-NEGOTIABLE THRESHOLD.\n\nDEFAULT SEAT COUNT RULE: A request for \"a license\" or \"X licenses\" MUST be interpreted as a request for single-seat licenses. Therefore, \"a license\" equals 1 seat, and \"5 licenses\" equals 5 seats. Only terms like \"Lab License,\" \"departmental,\" or other group descriptors imply multi-user intent.\n\nExclusions: We are NOT interested in self-serve, individual purchases, renewals, upgrades, cancellations, refunds, or general inquiries without clear NEW purchase intent. Leads related to existing, past, or inactive licenses are also excluded.\n\nThe lead's origin is academic.\n\nInputs:\n\nthread: The full conversation or inquiry details (THIS IS PARAMOUNT).\n\nsubject: The subject line of the inquiry.\n\nYour task is to analyze the provided thread content FIRST, then subject, to determine if the lead qualifies as a quality lead for a NEW, full-service academic license.\n\nEVALUATION STEPS (ABSOLUTE STRICT HIERARCHY):\n\nMANDATORY INSTRUCTION: You MUST evaluate these steps in strict numerical order. If any disqualification condition is met in Step 1, you MUST set is_quality_lead = false AND STOP ALL FURTHER EVALUATION. DO NOT proceed to Step 3 seeking a reason to qualify a lead that has already failed a disqualification check.\n\nStep 1: IMMEDIATE DISQUALIFICATION BASED ON SCALE (PRIORITY 1 - READ THREAD FIRST)\nSet is_quality_lead = false immediately if ANY of the following conditions are true. If a condition is met, STOP EVALUATION.\n\nD0. Insufficient Scale (ABSOLUTE DISQUALIFIER):\n\nA) Explicit Low Seat Count: User explicitly requests 12 seats or fewer. Per the Default Seat Count Rule, a request for \"X licenses\" must be treated as a request for \"X seats\" (e.g., \"8 licenses\" is treated as 8 seats and is disqualified). \"A license\" is 1 seat and is disqualified.\n\nB) Multiple Small, Separate Quotes: User asks for several quote options, where each individual option is for 12 seats or fewer (e.g., \"a quote for 1 license and another for 5 licenses\"). This MUST be disqualified.\n\nC) Ambiguous Small-Scale Language: User asks for a single \"Lab license,\" \"group license,\" or similar but DOES NOT specify a seat count of 13 or more.\n\nStep 2: OTHER DISQUALIFYING FACTORS (PRIORITY 2 - Only proceed if NOT disqualified in Step 1)\nSet is_quality_lead = false if ANY of the following are met. If found, STOP EVALUATION.\n\nD1. Existing Account/Status Clarification: The user's primary intent is to resolve issues or inquire about any existing, past, or inactive license.\n\nD2. No New Purchase Intent: The thread contains NO explicit mention of an intent to purchase a NEW license.\n\nStep 3: QUALIFICATION FOR FULL-SERVICE ACADEMIC LEAD (Proceed ONLY if NOT disqualified)\nSet is_quality_lead = true if the intent is for a NEW purchase and ANY of the following indicators of scale are present:\n\nQ1. Qualification by Explicit Seat Count (ABSOLUTE MINIMUM): The user explicitly requests 13 seats or more (e.g., 13, 15, 20). A seat count of 12 or less NEVER qualifies.\n\nQ2. Qualification by Qualitative Plurality: The user uses descriptive phrases implying a large group, such as \"multiple labs,\" \"several groups,\" \"a few PIs,\" or the plural \"lab licenses.\"\n\nCRITICAL CLARIFICATION: This rule applies to words, not a simple plural of \"licenses\" with a low number.\n\nQ3. Qualification by Institutional Language: The user asks about a \"departmental license,\" \"institutional access,\" \"site license,\" or \"buying for our entire college/school/university.\"\n\nImportant Notes:\n\nThread Dominance for Disqualification: If the thread content explicitly indicates a disqualifying factor, it overrides a potentially positive subject line.\n\nNo Inference on Scale: Your primary directive is to enforce the 13-seat minimum without exception or interpretation.\n\nOutput:\nProvide a JSON object with two keys:\n\nis_quality_lead: Boolean (true or false)\n\nreason: A concise summary (â‰¤ 30 words) clearly justifying your classification.","outputSchema":{"Is Quality Lead":"Indicates whether the lead
